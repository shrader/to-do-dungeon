# to-do-dungeon
A gamified to-do list for my son

This was a quick project just to test out some ideas and get my son more excited about completing some tasks around the house. As such there are a bunch of known bugs that should be fixed eventually. The project is not responsive so if you view it on anything other than a computer it will be messed up, and the same goes for if you resize the window too much. Much of the code could be refactored to be cleaner and more straight forward. There are more issues than that I'm sure but for a fun quick project and proof of concept I liked it.
