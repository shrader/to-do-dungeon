# to-do-dungeon
A gamified to-do list for my son

This was a quick project just to test out some ideas and get my son more excited about completing some tasks around the house. As such there are a bunch of known bugs that should be fixed eventually. For starters it focuses on only 3 to-do items. The project is not responsive so if you view it on anything other than a computer it will be messed up. Much of the code could be refactored to be cleaner and more straight forward. For a fun quick project and proof of concept I liked it.
