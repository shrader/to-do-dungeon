# to-do-dungeon
A gamified to-do list for my son

This was a quick project just to test out some ideas and get my son more excited about completing some tasks around the house.  It was designed to be quick and simple so it focuses on only 3 to-do items, but this could be adjust easily. The project also is not responsive so if you view it on anything other than a computer it will be messed up. For a fun quick project and proof of concept though, I thought it turned out alright, and most importantly it met the stakeholder (aka my son) requirements.
